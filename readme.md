# Jumblr



## Objective
This project is an English word-based game, where a jumbled English word was given to the player to predict the right word. The user will be given three attempts initially to predict the word. The player will be credited with coins as he guesses each level. For every failed attempt, the playerâ€™s coin will be debited. A leaderboard will display the top 10 players based on their coins

## Functionalities

 - It allows the user to create an account and save their progress,
   and coins.  
 - It will fetch the correct English word from the
   database and generate a randomized order of the word for the user to
   unscramble.  
 - It verifies if the user's input matches the correct
   word. If it does, credit the user with coins and move them onto the
   next level. If it does not, debit the user's coins and inform them
   that they have an incorrect answer. 
  - The user will be awarded coins
   for each correct answer. They will also lose coins for each incorrect
   answer.  
  - It allows the user to pass through levels of difficulty,
   with each level having a different word difficulty.  
  - The leaderboard displays the top 10 players based on the number of coins
   they have earned.
